- no credit card required for trial
- full scope of services incl. Spring Cloud Services
- API version 
- provides very helpful alternative with PCF Dev VM

### IBM Bluemix

- 30-day trial, continue for free under certain limit with credit card backup
- setup easy, more complex UI
- very big and IBM flavored service scope, no Spring Cloud Services
- extensions like OpenWhisk for serverless implementation

### GE Predix

- Registration requires mulitple days of verification and gets revoked?
- Sounds like best deal in terms of free services and developer account
- to be confirmed

### SAP YaaS

- beta state (by all means)
- very complex and confusing offering and "getting there"
- sounds like good deal in terms of developer services
- CF does not recognize subscription and becomes useless without Orgs and spaces
- to be continued
